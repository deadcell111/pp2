"""Example
Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:"""

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

"""Example
Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:"""

print(100 + 5 * 3)

"""Example
Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:"""

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
